README: Vectored Thrust Aircraft Modeling and Control Project
Overview
This project involves the modeling, analysis, and control of a vectored thrust aircraft using advanced control engineering techniques. The primary focus is on the stability and performance of the system, leveraging state-space and transfer-function models for thorough analysis and control design. MATLAB and Python are used for simulations to validate the control strategies.

Project Objectives
Non-linear System Analysis: Start with a non-linear system model representing the vectored thrust aircraft and analyze its dynamics.
Linearization: Linearize the non-linear model to simplify the system representation for control design.
Stability Analysis: Perform comprehensive stability analysis using both state-space and transfer-function models, focusing on eigenvalue and Lyapunov methods.
Control Design:
State-Feedback Control: Design a state-feedback controller to achieve desired closed-loop stability and performance.
Observer Design: Implement an observer-based feedback control system for enhanced real-time performance.
Simulation and Validation: Simulate system responses to various inputs such as unit steps and impulses, validating the effectiveness of the control strategies.
